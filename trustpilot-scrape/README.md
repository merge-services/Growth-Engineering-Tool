# Python script for scraping Trustpilot reviews using Beautiful Soup

*Note that Trustpilotâ€™s HTML may be updated, in which case you should update the `class` names in your code.*

## Update the URL

Update the `response` variable URL with your company name:

`response = requests.get(f"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/**COMPANY_NAME_HERE**?page={i}")`

## Page numbers
Update which Trustpilot pages are scraped using these variables:

`from_page = 1`

`to_page = 50`

## Final dataframe
If you hit any Trustpilot request limits you can wait a while before running the next batch of pages.

Once you've scraped all the pages you need, you can run the last two lines to create the final dataframe `df_reviews` from the lists.
